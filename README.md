# IGNGameAnalysisInsights

IGNGameAnalysisInsights is an exploration and analysis of video game data from IGN, aimed at discovering patterns, trends, and associations within the gaming industry. Utilising data sourced from Kaggle, this project employs analytical and machine learning techniques to analyse various aspects of games, such as scores, genres, and platforms. The analysis is complemented by detailed visualizations created in Tableau and advanced analysis techniques such as association rule learning.

# Project Structure
Analysis.py: Contains the core analysis code, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of visualisations like bar plots and whisker plots. This script lays the groundwork for understanding the dataset's fundamental characteristics.

adv_analysis.py: Focuses on advanced analysis techniques, specifically association rule learning. This script uncovers interesting relationships between game attributes such as genres, platforms, and scores, providing deeper insights into what factors contribute to a game's success or popularity.

# Association Rule Learning Highlights
The association rule learning analysis revealed intriguing relationships, such as a strong association between strategy games and high ratings on PC platforms, indicating a potentially underserved market segment. Other findings include the relationship between game platforms like Xbox 360 and specific genres, suggesting targeted strategies for game development and marketing.

# Visualisation
The project uses Tableau for data visualizsation, offering an interactive and engaging way to explore the data. From the most popular platforms to the most prolific genres, these visualisations provide a quick understanding of the gaming industry's evolution.
